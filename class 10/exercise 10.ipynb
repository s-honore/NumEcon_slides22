    "While baking a pizza or finding the sum of 2+2 can be described in a few lines of code navigating a self-driving car is not that easy. Imagine we follow a specific route and the navigation system says that the car should turn left in 500 metres. The algorithm that actually solves this is extremely complex. Suppose if we should code it from scratch. As such we should do a ton of algorithmic operations e.g.,  What speed should we approach the turn with, the gearing, are there other cars, what about traffic lights, what is the angle we should turn etc. Furthermore, alot of these operations likely also interact in complex ways. In other words our algorithm likely suffer from high - if not exponential - complexity. This is were machine learning comes in. Essentially we allow the computer to discover its own algorithms instead of telling it what to do. "

However, when you only have 500 metres to make a decision before turning left complexity is of paramount importance. No time for slow algorithms here. Otherwise, we may crash.

    "Let me give you a real life story of this. Currently i am working on a dataset with roughly 500 million observations. The dataset takes up roughly 16GB of memory once loaded, but my computer can only handle 8GB at a time. Therefore, every operation i do takes quite a while to run. The datasets contains pricing data which needs to be sorted. Given i don't want to wait for a day or two the choice of algorithm to solve this is very important. If i choose bubble-sort i know that it is $O(n^2)$ which means that the number of operations required is $500.000.000^2 = 25.000.000.000.000.000$ operations. If i choose quicksort as implented in NumPy it will \"only\" require $500.000.000 * ln(500.000.000) \\approx 10.000.000.000$ operations - quite a difference! \n",
